## RPI as git backup

Got an old Raspberry collecting dust, maybe even one of those Raspberry 1B models from 2013? Why not use it as a cheap backup server for your various git repositories?

### How it works

What to mention here: CRON, scripts, ssh key, size requirements

### Setup

What to mention here: Basic RPI setup, which packages to install, CRON, how to setup ssh keys

### Limitations

* No http repos
* bad observability / no notification mechanism
